				Sponge Bob had a wild dream and he fell into this wonderland.<br>
				What he needs to do right now is keep jumping and moving to avoid hitting the roof or falling to the bottom.<br>
				He also has to keep his health above 0 to be alive.<br>
				He can jump from platform to platform to prevent him from falling to the bottom and hitting the roof.<br><br>
				There is a regular platform that has no effect.<br>
				There is a bouncing platform where Sponge Bob gets a boost up whenever he touches it.<br>
				There is a rolling platform that has no special effect but moving in a certain horizontal range.<br>
				There is a roving platform that can moves Sponge Bob to the right side.<br>
				There is a transient platform that if Bob stands on it long enough, it will disappear and Sponge Bob will fall down.<br>
				There is a invisible platform that only if Bob falls onto it will it appear.<br>
				There is a dangerous platform where Bob will keep losing health when Bobs stands on those platforms.<br>
				However, if Bob stands on other platforms, Bob can get health.<br><br>
				
				Bob's health is shown at the upper middle.<br>
				The current score is at the upper left. Bob gains points whenever Bob falls onto a platform. Remember Bob can only gain one point on each platform.<br>
				However, Bob gain 3 points when Bob falls onto the invisible platform.<br>
				You can view current level on the top right. The higher your score is, the higher level you are, meantime the harder the game gets.<br>
				
				There are items occasionally to be collected on the platform.<br>
				Sneakers can speed Bob up.<br>
				Hamburgers can make Bob bigger than normal.<br>
				The left bottom shows your current item. Remember, you can only have one item with you at any given time.<br><br>
				Now, go Bob!
