Sponge Bob had a wild dream and he fell into a wonderland.     
If you choose "New Game", you will enter a random wonderland.

What he needs to do right now is keep jumping and moving to avoid hitting the roof or falling to the bottom.     
He also has to keep his health above 0 to be alive.     
He can jump from platform to platform to prevent him from falling to the bottom and hitting the roof.     

#######################################     
There is a regular platform that has no effect.     
There is a bouncing platform where Sponge Bob gets a boost up whenever he touches it.     
There is a rolling platform that has no special effect but moving in a certain horizontal range.     
There is a roving platform that can moves Sponge Bob to the right side.     
There is a transient platform that if Bob stands on it long enough, it will disappear and Sponge Bob will fall down.     
There is a invisible platform that only if Bob falls onto it will it appear.     
There is a dangerous platform where Bob will keep losing health when Bobs stands on those platforms.     
However, if Bob stands on other platforms, Bob can get health.     
			
#######################################	     	
Bob's health is shown at the upper middle.     
The current score is at the upper left. Bob gains points whenever Bob falls onto a platform. Remember Bob can only gain one point on each platform.     
However, Bob gain 3 points when Bob falls onto the invisible platform.     
You can view current level on the top right. The higher your score is, the higher level you are, meantime the harder the game gets.     

#######################################		     		
There are items occasionally to be collected on the platform.     
Some items can speed Bob up.     
Some items can make Bob bigger than normal.     
The left bottom shows your current item. Remember, you can only have one item with you at any given time.
